    "### 1 - WHAT IS THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?\n",
    " The theorem expresses that as the size of the sample expands,  the distribution of the mean among multiple samples will be like a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "if we sample from apopulation using a sufficiently large sample size, the mean of the samples (also known as the sample population) will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling), the mean tending to the mean of the population and variance equal to the variance of the population divided by the size of the sampling. Whatâ€™s especially important is that this will be true regardless of the distribution of the original population.\n",
    "#### According to Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution will approach a normal distribution.\n",
